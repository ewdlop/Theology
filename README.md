## Divine Name Transformation

yawhel elo elohim 
yahweh leo leohim

### Id-Ego-Superego Analysis

The transformation from "yawhel elo elohim" to "yahweh leo leohim" represents a psycho-theological framework using Freudian concepts:

1. **Superego (yahweh/yawhel)**: The divine name YHWH (Yahweh) represents the Superego - the moral authority, conscience, and idealized self. The correction from "yawhel" to "yahweh" symbolizes the refinement of the superego through proper understanding.

2. **Ego (elo/leo)**: The transformation of "elo" to "leo" (anagram) represents the Ego - the mediating function between divine command and earthly existence. The anagram suggests the Ego's role in reorganizing and interpreting reality.

3. **Id (elohim/leohim)**: "Elohim" (plural form of God) transformed to "leohim" represents the Id - the primal, plural forces of the unconscious. The plurality suggests multiple drives and the transformation indicates the Id's dynamic nature.

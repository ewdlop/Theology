# Theology

A repository exploring theological concepts through mathematical and psychological frameworks.

## Categorical Theology: Pushforward and Pullback

### Overview

This project explores the correspondence between category theory operations and eschatological concepts:

**Pushforward (Covariant Functor) ↔ Maitreya**
- **Direction**: Present → Future
- **Operation**: Projects current state forward in time
- **Preserves**: The direction of temporal flow
- **Theological Meaning**: Future-oriented hope and enlightenment
- **Example**: Maitreya, the future Buddha who will appear to teach the dharma

**Pullback (Contravariant Functor) ↔ Messiah**
- **Direction**: Future ← Past
- **Operation**: References fulfillment back to origins
- **Reverses**: Direction to validate prophecy
- **Theological Meaning**: Present fulfillment of ancient promises
- **Example**: Messiah as fulfillment of ancient covenants and prophecies

### Categorical Duality

The pushforward-pullback duality demonstrates how different religious traditions approach eschatological hope:

- **Maitreya (Buddhism)**: Pushes dharma forward into a future age of teaching
- **Messiah (Abrahamic)**: Pulls prophecy backward, validating past divine promises

Together, they form a complete categorical framework for understanding temporal mediation in religious thought.

### Running the Categorical Theology Module

```bash
python categorical_theology.py
```

This will display a detailed explanation of the pushforward-pullback correspondence with concrete examples.

### Running the Visualization Experiment

```bash
python pushforward_pullback_experiment.py
```

**Controls:**
- **SPACE**: Toggle between overview and detailed view
- **LEFT arrow**: Focus on Pushforward (Maitreya)
- **RIGHT arrow**: Focus on Pullback (Messiah)
- **ESC**: Exit the experiment

## Archangel Michael: Historical Clarification

### Common Misconception Addressed

This module addresses the question: "Did people name Archangel Michael after Michelangelo's painting on an arched building?"

**Answer:** No! The naming relationship is actually the opposite:

- **Archangel Michael** appears in ancient religious texts dating back to ~164 BCE (Book of Daniel) and earlier
- **Michelangelo Buonarroti** (the artist) was born in 1475 CE, over 1,600 years later
- Michelangelo was **named AFTER** the Archangel Michael, following Christian tradition
- "Michelangelo" means "Michael the Angel" in Italian

### Running the Historical Timeline Module

```bash
python archangel_michael_history.py
```

This displays a comprehensive timeline showing:
- Ancient textual references to Archangel Michael (Hebrew Bible, New Testament, Quran)
- Michelangelo's biographical information and works
- Clarification of the naming relationship
- Explanation of the "arc building" (Sistine Chapel's arched ceiling) connection

## Divine Name Transformation

yawhel elo elohim 
yahweh leo leohim

### Id-Ego-Superego Analysis

The transformation from "yawhel elo elohim" to "yahweh leo leohim" represents a psycho-theological framework using Freudian concepts:

1. **Superego (yahweh/yawhel)**: The divine name YHWH (Yahweh) represents the Superego - the moral authority, conscience, and idealized self. The correction from "yawhel" to "yahweh" symbolizes the refinement of the superego through proper understanding.

2. **Ego (elo/leo)**: The transformation of "elo" to "leo" (anagram) represents the Ego - the mediating function between divine command and earthly existence. The anagram suggests the Ego's role in reorganizing and interpreting reality.

3. **Id (elohim/leohim)**: "Elohim" (plural form of God) transformed to "leohim" represents the Id - the primal, plural forces of the unconscious. The plurality suggests multiple drives and the transformation indicates the Id's dynamic nature.

## Topological Defects in Theological Framework

### Overview

This project explores topological defects from physics as theological metaphors for stable structures arising from symmetry breaking.

**Topological Defects:**
In physics, topological defects are stable configurations that arise when symmetry is broken. They cannot be removed by continuous transformations and are classified by dimensionality.

**Theological Analogy:**
Just as physical symmetries break to create defects, divine symmetries break to create persistent theological structures:

1. **Monopole (0D)** ↔ **The Incarnation**
   - Point singularity where infinite meets finite
   - Breaks transcendence-immanence symmetry
   - Topologically stable configuration
   - Homotopy: π₂(S²) = ℤ

2. **Vortex/String (1D)** ↔ **Prophetic Lineage**
   - Linear axis through history with spiritual circulation
   - Protected by winding number of tradition
   - Connects past and future
   - Homotopy: π₁(S¹) = ℤ

3. **Domain Wall (2D)** ↔ **Denominational Boundaries**
   - Surface separating different theological phases
   - Energy barrier to cross traditions
   - Can merge (ecumenism) or persist (schism)
   - Homotopy: π₀ (discrete)

4. **Texture (3D)** ↔ **Doctrinal Interpretation Space**
   - Volume-filling hermeneutical landscape
   - Gradual variation without sharp boundaries
   - Maps interpretation complexity
   - Homotopy: π₃(S³) = ℤ

### Running the Topological Defect Module

```bash
python topological_defect.py
```

This displays detailed explanations of all four defect types with their theological interpretations and homotopy groups.

### Running the Topological Defect Visualization

```bash
python topological_defect_experiment.py
```

**Controls:**
- **1-4**: View individual defect types
- **SPACE**: Return to overview
- **ESC**: Exit the experiment

## PsychoPy Experiments

This repository includes multiple PsychoPy experiments that visualize theological concepts through interactive demonstrations.

# Theology

A repository exploring theological concepts through mathematical and psychological frameworks.

## Categorical Theology: Pushforward and Pullback

### Overview

This project explores the correspondence between category theory operations and eschatological concepts:

**Pushforward (Covariant Functor) ↔ Maitreya**
- **Direction**: Present → Future
- **Operation**: Projects current state forward in time
- **Preserves**: The direction of temporal flow
- **Theological Meaning**: Future-oriented hope and enlightenment
- **Example**: Maitreya, the future Buddha who will appear to teach the dharma

**Pullback (Contravariant Functor) ↔ Messiah**
- **Direction**: Future ← Past
- **Operation**: References fulfillment back to origins
- **Reverses**: Direction to validate prophecy
- **Theological Meaning**: Present fulfillment of ancient promises
- **Example**: Messiah as fulfillment of ancient covenants and prophecies

### Categorical Duality

The pushforward-pullback duality demonstrates how different religious traditions approach eschatological hope:

- **Maitreya (Buddhism)**: Pushes dharma forward into a future age of teaching
- **Messiah (Abrahamic)**: Pulls prophecy backward, validating past divine promises

Together, they form a complete categorical framework for understanding temporal mediation in religious thought.

### Running the Categorical Theology Module

```bash
python categorical_theology.py
```

This will display a detailed explanation of the pushforward-pullback correspondence with concrete examples.

### Running the Visualization Experiment

```bash
python pushforward_pullback_experiment.py
```

**Controls:**
- **SPACE**: Toggle between overview and detailed view
- **LEFT arrow**: Focus on Pushforward (Maitreya)
- **RIGHT arrow**: Focus on Pullback (Messiah)
- **ESC**: Exit the experiment

## Divine Name Transformation

yawhel elo elohim 
yahweh leo leohim

### Id-Ego-Superego Analysis

The transformation from "yawhel elo elohim" to "yahweh leo leohim" represents a psycho-theological framework using Freudian concepts:

1. **Superego (yahweh/yawhel)**: The divine name YHWH (Yahweh) represents the Superego - the moral authority, conscience, and idealized self. The correction from "yawhel" to "yahweh" symbolizes the refinement of the superego through proper understanding.

2. **Ego (elo/leo)**: The transformation of "elo" to "leo" (anagram) represents the Ego - the mediating function between divine command and earthly existence. The anagram suggests the Ego's role in reorganizing and interpreting reality.

3. **Id (elohim/leohim)**: "Elohim" (plural form of God) transformed to "leohim" represents the Id - the primal, plural forces of the unconscious. The plurality suggests multiple drives and the transformation indicates the Id's dynamic nature.

## PsychoPy Experiments

This repository includes multiple PsychoPy experiments that visualize theological concepts through interactive demonstrations.

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
